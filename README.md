Hurricane-game
==============
This was a tower defense game based on the Hurricane Sandy incident a fellow student and I made for class. The following java files are responsible for:

Enemy: Handles enemy pattern and behavior
Frame: Draws the window for the game
Screen: Draws the game inside of the window
Room: Maps out the enemy path
Store: Tower defenses are placed on a small gui inside the game and can be drag and dropped into the game
Value: Stores damage value for all in game objects
